Planning

A) COMPLETE Sudoku Grid is an int[9][9] Array. Need to mark all empty values as null and need to marked filled values as unavailable. Maybe a boolean isAvailable array for true = available and false = occupied
B) MODIFIED (see D) find(NUMBER) will search for all locations of a number and return an arraylist of grid spots that contains the number.
C) check(GRID SPOT) will search the spot to see if isAvailable(GRID SPOT) crosses with any values from the arraylist returned from find(NUMBER)
D) Class that holds the locations of the numbers (ie grid points)
E) availLocation needs a better data structure, will try a stack.
F) enum for each square
G) Make function to parse through grids that are not in squares
H) BEFORE NEXT TIME:::::::
 -----> Read 7/20 of Day-to-Day-Doc, then follow the directions.
 -----> Make a UML diagram for Classes
 -----> Make a code flow chart because i'm lost
